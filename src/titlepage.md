# notes

A collection of notes I've been continuously keeping whilst learning topics in Computer Science. 

I've tried my best to create some organization and genericism in each entry, however some of my notes are more akin to case-studies, or tutorials, which I had either written from scratch or adapted/updated and consequently sourced where relevant.

I don't anticipate these notes being of particular use en-masse to anyone other than myself, but maybe here and there is something that may be useful for you.

The notes are primarly kept so that I have a quick reference, that I know inside out, wherever I am.
