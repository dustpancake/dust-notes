# Machine Learning

## Overview

```{tableofcontents}
```

I have created a separate repository [ml-dnn-resources](https://github.com/furges/ml-dnn-resources) where I will be documenting my exploration of machine learning concepts.

I will use this directory as a link and overview, with installation instructions, and more complete recipes included. 

As always, this repository is a work in progress.
