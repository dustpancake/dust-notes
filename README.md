# Notes

[![Pages](https://github.com/febk/notes/actions/workflows/gh_publish.yml/badge.svg)](https://febk.github.io/notes/titlepage.html)

Notes I've written up from different projects, my own personal language references, and cook book. This project is designed for me to have a queryable reference of things I commonly do on computers, so I maintain a way of keeping this information at hand, and my hope is that it may prove useful for anyone else, either as overviews or through its recipes.
