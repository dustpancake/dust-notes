# Advent of Code notes 

I'm participating in the [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/), this time using only the Julia language to learn more of the internals. 

This section of my notes holds things I have been learning whilst completing the tasks. I will not include solutions for or details of (until maybe after the event has ended) the tasks, but more conceptual ideas and references for the Julia language.
